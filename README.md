# Sam's Project Code

This repository is a home for the R code I have used to analyse data for different projects, papers, and applications. I don't pretend to be a master coder, but this repository is my small way of helping to support open-access in science, and hopefully some people may find it useful. 

Like most others, my coding skills have developed over the years with the help of dedicated teachers, generous collegues, and google. To all those who have contributed to these analyse and scripts, thank you!
